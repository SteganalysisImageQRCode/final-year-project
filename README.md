# Steganalysis of Images using QRC
The steganalysis application deals with the concept of combining cryptography & Steganography.Steganalysis is an efficient technique used to encrypt any form of data and hide the key behind an image or any other digital media to make them more secure. 
It can be used to carry out hidden exchanges and hence can enhance individual privacy. 
The security of Steganalysis can be improved by using Quick Response Code to make it more user-friendly.
# advantages:
This application can enhance the security and improve privacy.
Due to the usage of Complex algorithms this is difficult to attacks.
It is not vulnerable to threats and attacks.

# Proposed system:
The steganalysis technique can be implemented to encrypt any form of file and hide its key behind an image.it uses AES encryption.
 This image can be converted to QRCode which can be decrypted by any user-friendly device like desktop, Mobile, scanners etc..,
It can support on any operating system  like Windows, MacOS, blackberry, android etc.,

# Future Enhancements:
The future enhancement in the further proposed system is that the software can improve the security for the files that are shared via cloud. It can make use of the database such that it can promote multiple senders and receivers. The filename and also the password can be stored separately in the database. This analysis using QRC can be applied in transmission of big data to overcome the shortfalls of digital media and its associated security techniques. It can be used in cloud data sharing to securely share information.
